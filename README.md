# ML-Basics
### Python implementation of basic ML algorithms from scratch using numpy and pandas

## 1. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- KNN is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).

## 2. Linear Regression
- Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).
- Model:

- Equations:

## 3. Logistic Regression
- Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
- Model:

## 4. Decision Trees
- Decision tree learning is a method commonly used in data mining. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables.
- Model: ![Decision Trees 1](images/DecisionTree/chart19.png), ![Decision Trees 2](images/DecisionTree/chart23.png), ![Decision Trees 3](images/DecisionTree/chart29.png)

## 5. Random Forest
- TBD

## 6. Naive Bayes
- Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
